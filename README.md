### Alerting journalists to changes on the web

Klaxon is a Ruby on Rails app that enables reporters and editors to monitor scores of websites for newsworthy changes. When it finds something new on one of the pages or files it's watching, it emails an alert and pings a Slack channel.

Built and refined in the newsroom of [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/), Klaxon has provided our journalists with many news tips, giving us early warnings and valuable time to pursue stories.

We plan to release Klaxon as a free and open-source application for other newsrooms to employ. If you'd like to use Klaxon and be notified when it is released, great. If you are comfortable with Rails and want to contribute to Klaxon's development, even better. Either way, [let us know](http://goo.gl/forms/P6TE5b1eOh) so we can get in touch.
